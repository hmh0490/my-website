    I am an accomplished finance professional with a diverse international background in banking and finance.

    financial markets and strategies. Notably, I have also successfully passed the rigorous examination for the 
    Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certificate, highlighting my commitment to professional excellence.
    
    Throughout my career, I have developed a strong passion for programming and have acquired valuable experience in this
    area. I also proactively pursued coding skills to complement my finance background. Through self-study and 
    practical application, I have acquired a strong foundation in programming languages relevant to my profession.
    
    I am now driven to combine my profound knowledge of finance with my software development capabilities, aiming to leverage
    technology to optimize processes, automate tasks, and develop sophisticated models for data analysis and forecasting, 
    and deliver innovative solutions.
