    Hi, I am Hanh!
     
    I am an accomplished finance professional with a diverse international background in banking and finance. 
    I have gained extensive experience in various roles, allowing me to develop a comprehensive understanding of 
    financial markets and strategies. Notably, I have also successfully passed the rigorous examination for the 
    Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certificate, highlighting my commitment to professional excellence.
    
    Throughout my career, I have developed a strong passion for programming and have acquired valuable skills in this
    area. I also proactively pursued programming skills to complement my finance expertise. Through self-study and 
    practical application, I have acquired a strong foundation in programming languages relevant to the finance sector.
    
    I am now driven to combine my profound knowledge of finance with my programming capabilities, aiming to leverage
    technology to optimize financial processes, automate tasks, and develop sophisticated models for data analysis 
    and forecasting, and deliver innovative solutions.
